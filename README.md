Keeping a record of coding challenges completed!

## Challenge 1: solveMeFirst (Javascript)
Complete function solveMeFirst to compute the sum of two integers
Constraints: 1 <= a, b <= 1000

## Challenge 2: simpleArraySum
Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements
Contstraints: 0 < n, ar[i] <= 1000

## Challenge 3: compareTriplets
Function Description:

compareTriplets has the following parameter(s):

int a[3]: Alice's challenge rating
int b[3]: Bob's challenge rating
Return

int[2]: Alice's score is in the first position, and Bob's score is in the second.

## Challenge 4: aVeryBigSum

Return the sum of all array elements

## Challenge 5: diagonalDifference

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sum of its diagonals.

## Challenge 6: plusMinus

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero.  Print decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after decimal.

## Challenge 7: staircase

Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.
- Its base and height are both equal to n.  It is drawn using # symbols and spaces.  The last line is not preceded by space.

## Challenge 8: miniMaxSum

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers.  Then, print the respective min and max values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

## Challenge 9: birthdayCakeCandles

Given an array of "candle sizes," count how many are the tallest height. 

## Challenge 10: timeConversion

Given a string s in a 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military time.

## Challenge 11: gradingStudents

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.
- If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5
- If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade

## Challenge 12: countApplesAndOranges
Determine the number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house
- The red region denotes the house, where s is the start point, and t is the endpoint.  The apple tree is to the left of the house, the orange tree is to its right.
- Assume the trees are located on a single point, where the apples tree is at point a, and the organge tree is at point b.
- When a fruit falls, it lands d units of distance from its tree of origin along the x-axis.  A negative value of d means the fruit fell d units to the tree's left, and positive d means it falls d units to the right.
- output should be number of apples in range on one line, then number of oranges in range on next line
