// Heaps are a category of trees, so everything that applies to trees will apply to heaps

// Min and Max heaps (we will focus on the latter)

// Binary Heap: in max heap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes (opposite is true in a min heap)

// Still can only have up to two children per parent node
// sibling order is not guaranteed, however
// left is not necessarily the smaller number, etc.

// a binary heap is as compact as possible... all the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

// used to implement priority queue
// also used with graph traversal algorithms
