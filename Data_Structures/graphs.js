// Collection of nodes and connections between those nodes

// Uses include social networks, location/mapping, routing algorithms, visual hierarchy, file system optimizations, recommendation algorithms, etc.

// Terminology: 

// Vertex: a node
// Edge: connection between nodes
// Weighted/Unweighted: values assigned to distances between vertices
// Directed/Undirected: directions assigned to distanced between vertices

// Types:

// Tree is a special type of graph where there is only one path between two nodes

// Directed graph: there is a direction(s) assigned to the edge (one-way or two-way)
// Undirected graph: all edges are two-way (or have no direction... this would mean the same thing)

// Weighted graph: edges have a value associated to them
// Unweighted: edges have no value
