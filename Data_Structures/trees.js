// trees are data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship

// trees are non-linear... more than one pathway through a tree (branching)
// compared to singly linked lists... no branching, only one pathway

// node can only point towards child
// with trees, no pointing towards parent or sibling(s)

// root is the top node in a tree
// child is node directly connected to another node moving away from root
// leaf: a node with no children
// edge: connection between one node and another (what I would refer to as a branch on a tree)

// USES FOR TREES

// HTML DOM, network routing, abstract syntax trees (explaining syntax of programming language), AI, decision tree, folders in operating systems, JSON

// BINARY TREES

// binary tree: each node can have at most two children (they can have less)

// BINARY SEARCH TREES

// special case of binary tree
// sorted in a particular way (data that can be compared)

// EXAMPLE: from root integer, every node less than parent branches to left, every branch to the right is greater

// searching a binary tree:
// similar to a binary search in an array
