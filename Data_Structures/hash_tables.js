// sometimes called a hash map

// hash tables are used to store key-value pairs (basically an object/map in js)
// like arrays, but keys are not ordered
// fast for finding, adding, and removing values

// Ex. storing color hex values with more readable keys, like "pink"

// We'd need a way to convert keys into valid array indices
// A function that performs this task is called a hash function

// Ex. "pink" could correspond with 0, "red" with 1, etc.
